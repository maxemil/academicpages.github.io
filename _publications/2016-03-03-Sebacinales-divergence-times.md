title: "Divergence times and phylogenetic patterns of sebacinales, a highly diverse and widespread fungal lineage"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-03-03-Sebacinales-divergence-times
excerpt: 'Relaxed molecular clock analyses indicate that Sebacinales originated late Permian within Basidiomycota, and their split into Sebacinaceae and Serendipitaceae nom. prov. likely occurred during the late Jurassic and the early Cretaceous, coinciding with major diversifications of land plants.'
